dependency injection : 
========================

the process of injecting the depndencies into dependent 

dependent -> caller 
dependency -> called 



how many ways we can inject the dependencies here :
===================================================
1) setter injection 
2) constructor injection 

dependency injection though setter and inject premetive dependency :
====================================================================

dependent : PrintClass
dependency : message 



spring.xml 
==========
we have to configure both dependent and dependency information 


client.java
============
BeanFactory 
ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("spring.xml");

spring container will load all the dependent/dependencies from xml , it will register with spring container

ctx -> PrintClass, message = "welcome to spring ioc"


PrintClass obj = ctx.getBean(PrintClass.class);


sprin identifies is there any property tag configured inside the dependent 
if yes spring container will call setter method inside the dependent and pass the dependency value 

spring will create the object of dependency and return the object 



SpringDIWithObjectThough Setter:
================================
Employee->Address 

Student -> school
